1. Compile with CMake
    make all

2. Remove all executable file  
    make reset

3. Followinf executables will be created:
load, print, query, change, clean
	load: Loads the student information from file to shared memory.
	print: Prints the current information available on shared memory.
	query: Query a record in shared memory using command: `./query <studentID>`
	change: Perform any modification in the student information.
		Update: Update an attribute in student info using command `./change 1 PASSWORD <studentID> <attributeNumber> <Change>`
			Update Name: `./change 1 PASSWORD <studentID> 1 <New Name>`
			Update Address: ` ./change 1 PASSWORD <studentID> 2 <New Address>`
			Update Telephone: ` ./change 1 PASSWORD <studentID> 3 <New Telephone>`
		Delete: Delete a student record. `./change 2 PASSWORD <studentID>`
		Add: Add a new student record. `./change 3 PASSWORD <9-digit-studentID> <Name> <Address> <Telephone>`. Pls note, for simplicity of implementation, I did not consider spaces. So *Name* and *Address* must be one word only. 
	clean: Saves the current state of shared memory to a file and dumps the shared memory space and semaphores.

4. Run each executable in order to view or modify the records

5. Run `./clean` once all changes are made and wish to terminate the program.
